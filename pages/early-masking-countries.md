Based on prior experiences some countries treated the pandemic as aerosol from the earliest
opportunity and got their **own citizens** into masks, which is what you would do if you 
accepted it was airborne (or aerosols droplet nuclei -- all the same thing). **As well as masks, good border controls, great quarantine and outstanding test & trace**, all within a implicit "masks, air, distance" framework for individuals.
