Some countries have set fifteen-minute rule to gauge risk of infection when in the presence of some who has COVID-19 (and may or may not know it yet).  Other countries have the same rule, but choose five minutes. Both of these are arbitrary choices. You are **not** risk free if you are only 14 mins in an infected person's presence. You're not at risk if you are sixty-minutes in an infected person's presence and both of you wre well-fitting N95 (or FFP2 or KF94) masks. These time rules in western countries, have not taken into account other factors. They are just arbitrary choices by legal authorities. Test and Trace notifications (in the west) not taking into account the masked or not (not grade of mask/respirator) are consequentially flawed.

Here's a Twitter thread by @akm5376 discussing that:
