<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Iâ€™ve landed in Hong Kong after flying from Paris CDG, via London Heathrow. I now have to wait ~8 hours before I get my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#COVID19</a> test results and thus have ample time to tweet about my experience. <a href="https://t.co/jCDPuwrTzL">pic.twitter.com/jCDPuwrTzL</a></p>&mdash; Laurel Chor (@laurelchor) <a href="https://twitter.com/laurelchor/status/1260784481159442434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
