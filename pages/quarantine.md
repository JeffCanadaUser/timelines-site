What effective quarantine looks like **where "Zero COVID" is the goal**.

**Summary:** Some countries and regions have been quarantining incoming passengers in the arly days of the pandemic, and adding proof of test requirements when those were available.

# Countries and regions

## Doing zero-COVID to some degree (good quarantine)

Countries and regions where "Zero Covid" has been attempted or achieved, or is the official "everyone" strategy:

* Australia: A blip at the end of March, then another in August, Australia is now locked into zero-COVID
* China: **A terrible Jan/Feb/March for Hubei province** (Wuhan is in Hubei), but the country was not badly affected. Hubei included, China has been super-achieving since
* Hong Kong: Some bad months, but continually trying to get there
* New Zealand: Blip in April, but zero-COVID since
* Singapore: achieved by October, but with some increase from Jan 2021
* Taiwan: Apart from a bad April, zero-COVID is Taiwan's way
* Vietnam: Vietnam has held it from the start, tactically refining quarantine as it went 

Good quarantine is taking risky people to a facility to ensure they are isolated through incubation periods. It is also testing people on entry, and checking in with them during the key period after their arrival. Hotels with security staff ensuring compliance is one common way.

## No quarantine, no zero-COVID

* All other countries.
