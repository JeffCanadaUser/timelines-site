I now have to wait ~8 hours before I get my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#COVID19</a> test results and thus have ample time to tweet about my experience. <a href="https://t.co/jCDPuwrTzL">pic.twitter.com/jCDPuwrTzL</a></p>&mdash; Laurel Chor (@laurelchor) <a href="https://twitter.com/laurelchor/status/1260784481159442434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# Countries and regions

## Doing zero-COVID to some degree

Countries and regions where "Zero Covid" has been attempted or achieved, or is the official "everyone" strategy:

* Hong Kong: Some bad months, but continually trying to get there
* New Zealand: Blip in Apr 2020, but zero-COVID since
* China: Terrible Feb 2020 for Hubei provice, but the country was not badly affected. Hubei included, China has been super-achieving since.
* Singapore: achieved by Oct 2020, but with some increase from Jan 2021
* Taiwan: Apart from Apr 2020, zero-COVID locked in
