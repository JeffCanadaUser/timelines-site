Pertinent events and articles showing the aerosol nature of infection has been talked about for other diseases over the years. For the sake of this timeline, **aerosol** = **airborne** = **droplet nuclei**. These less-than 100 μm particles float in the air for some time and travel some distance. Whereas **droplets** (larger than 100 μm) fall under gravity to a surface - possibly within 2 meters.

Note: the medical and science communities are changing to a **100** μm (and above) definition of droplets. This was formerly **5** μm. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/linseymarr/status/1336318245348003840">See @linseymarr's tweets</a>. All smaller than 100 μm are aerosol.
