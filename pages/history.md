Pertinent events and articles showing aerosol nature of infection has been talked about for other diseases over the years. For the sake of this discussion **aerosol** = **airborne** = **droplet nuclei**. These less-than 5 μm float in the air for some time and travel some distance. Whereas **droplets** (larger than 5 μm) fall under gravity to a surface - possibly within 2 meters.
