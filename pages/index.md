We're fans of Prof Jose-Luis Jimenez, Prof Kimberly Prather and Prof Linsey Marr who have been educating the world on the aerosol transmission nature of COVID-19.

Their Twitter accounts: [@jljcolorado](https://twitter.com/jljcolorado), and [@kprather88](https://twitter.com/kprather88), and [@linseymarr](https://twitter.com/linseymarr) - which you should follow.
