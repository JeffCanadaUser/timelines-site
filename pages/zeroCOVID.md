# Some countries have achieved "Zero COVID"

Maintaining Zero COVID requires:

* [Quarantine](/quarantine)
* World-class "Test and Trace"

Getting to Zero COVID for an higher infection country requires the above two, and:

* Lockdown all the way through to where Zero COVID has been achieved
* Aggressive masks and cloth face coverings policies

# Other countries have different strategies

* **Flatten The Curve** - not overwhelm hospitals, but acknowledge at people will die. This is most countries. Depending on the R0 number and the availability of vaccines, there's a legitimate fear stay at home orders could just be repreated for long periods of time.
* **Herd Immunity before Vaccine availability** - countries are not admitting to this, Sweden and the UK have been accused of it at times during the pandemic. A hallmark of this strategy would be to not restrict movements and not enact mask mandates.

# Not to be confused with

* "Covid Zero" - a UK national campaign to do with [reducing infection in hospital](https://www.uhs.nhs.uk/AboutTheTrust/Newsandpublications/COVID-ZERO/COVID-ZERO.aspx)

# On Lockdowns

Lockdowns to acheive Zero COVID has been proven possible. Most countries running forms of "stay at home" orders are doing it to flatten the curve and not achieve Zero COVID.
