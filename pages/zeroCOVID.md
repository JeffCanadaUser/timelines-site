# Some countries have achieved "Zero COVID"

Maintaining Zero COVID requires:

* [Quarantine](/quarantine)
* World-class "Test and Trace"

Getting to Zero COVID for a higher-infection country requires the above two, and:

* A solid lockdown
* Aggressive masks and cloth face coverings policies

These need to be held to until Zero COVID has been fully achieved.

# Other countries have different strategies

* **Flatten The Curve** - not overwhelm hospitals, but acknowledge at people will die. This is most countries. Depending on the R0 number and the availability of vaccines, there is a legitimate fear 'stay at home' orders could just be relaxed and then repeated for long periods of time.
* **Herd Immunity before Vaccine availability** - countries are not admitting to this, Sweden and the UK have been accused of it at times during the pandemic. A hallmark of this strategy would be to not restrict movements and not enact solid mask mandates (or implement weak mask recommendations)

# Not to be confused with

* "Covid Zero" - a UK national campaign to do with [reducing infection in hospital](https://www.uhs.nhs.uk/AboutTheTrust/Newsandpublications/COVID-ZERO/COVID-ZERO.aspx)

# On Lockdowns

Lockdowns to achieve Zero COVID has been proven possible. Most countries running forms of "stay at home" orders are doing it to flatten the curve though and not achieve Zero COVID.
