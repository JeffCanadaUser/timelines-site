If you're in a country that has not eliminated COVID-19, wear a mask.

Any cloth face covering is better than nothing. But you should seek to get the **best mask that you can as soon as you can without depleting the stocks that emergency workers use**. Your cloth face covering:

* needs nose wire which should kept shaped to your nose while in use.
* should be multi-layer - three or more ideally
* should not have gaps at your cheeks, sides, or throat
  * should perhaps have a "fitter" added (see below)
* may concentrate virons on the outside - wash your hands after touching a dirty mask and wash/dry the mask after use.

If you're wearing a surgical-style mask that you bought from the supermarket or a corner store, consider a fitter (see below). The stretchy spandex (lycra) ones that are single layer are **really low self-protection**. 

If you can't wear a mask or cloth face covering stay at home and get food delivered. 

If you can afford it, get KF94 masks (that are not cloth or washable) for use when mixing with other in public. Citizen Scientist, Aaron Collins, [reviews masks for filtration effectiveness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fF_rzkmZD0ufN685YE7lg) and talks about KF94 masks quite a bit.  Leave the N95 and FFP2 masks/respirators for respective medical and emergency workers.

## Fitters (to be placed on top of your mask)

[This](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249101v1.full.pdf) University of Wisconsin Study (Rothamer et al 2020) is key: Use a "fitter".
