A few years back, Northwestern University (Knight Lab) made a Timeline 'widget': [timeline.knightlab.com](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) (TimelineJS3). That's open source on GitHub.

Moe recently, University of Idaho's the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) use that technology in a "static site generator" way of working via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): [github.com/thecdil/timelinejs-template](https://github.com/thecdil/timelinejs-template). See preview site [thecdil.github.io/timelinejs-template/](https://thecdil.github.io/timelinejs-template/)

## Pitch

**You should work with that CDIL-made template**

* Use the template to make your mini site
* Pick a domain name for it. 
* Host it on Github (or similar). 
* Learn markdown (Jekyll uses that) and JSON (for the events in the widget)
* Push "events" into your timline as fast as you like
* Encourage contributors via GitHub's "Pull Requests" workflow
* Also encourage contributors via GitHub's "issues" features (not as smooth)

Science: History-retaining merkle trees (such as Git) with static site generation (like Jekyll) and nice interactive widgets (like TimelineJS3) are a wave of the future - **the revolution will be merkleized**

## If you hate the idea of Jekyll & Git

* You can also deploy the timelines using TimelineJS3 by using GoogleDocs to hold the timeline. 
* There's a Wordpress plugin for the same TimelineJS3 + GoogleDoc way of working.
