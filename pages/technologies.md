**Timelines as a force for good.....**

A few years back, Northwestern University (Knight Lab) made an **interactive** timeline 'widget': [timeline.knightlab.com](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) (TimelineJS3). That's open source on GitHub. Key contributors: Joe Germuska, Zach Wise, Heather Billings, Jennifer Y Wilson, and Scott Bradley.

More recently, University of Idaho's the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) use that technology in a "static site generator" way of working via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and a timeline template for that: [github.com/thecdil/timelinejs-template](https://github.com/thecdil/timelinejs-template) with a few timeline entries (video, sound, text, pics). See their fantastic preview site: [thecdil.github.io/timelinejs-template](https://thecdil.github.io/timelinejs-template/). Key contributor: Evan Williamson

This site, its-airborne.org, has five interactive timelines to make our case for world recognition of this fact for COVID-19 and the rollout of airborne precautions after that. See them in the top☝️nav☝️of☝️THIS☝️page️. Here's one as a pic with some explanation in red;

## You should use these technologies for your own cause

**You should work with that CDIL-made template above**

* Use the template to make your mini site
* Pick a domain name for it. 
* Host it on Github (or similar). 
* Learn Markdown (Jekyll uses that) and JSON (for the events in the timeline widget)
* Push "events" into your timeline as fast as you like - the site redeploys for each "commit" you have pushed.
* Encourage contributors via GitHub's "Pull Requests" workflow (review and comment before publication)
* Also encourage contributors via GitHub's "issues" features (not as smooth as pull requests, but still a tool for conversation before publication)

Science: History-retaining merkle trees (such as Git) with static site generation (like Jekyll) and nice interactive widgets (like TimelineJS3) are a wave of the future - **the revolution will be merkleized**

### If you dislike the the "Jekyll" & "Git" techs

* You can also deploy the timelines using TimelineJS3 by using GoogleDocs to hold the timeline. See [timeline.knightlab.com/#make](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make)
* There's a [Wordpress plugin](GoogleDoc) for the same TimelineJS3 + GoogleDocs way of working.
